Change log for Reconstruction tools

============================================================

07/15/14 Guy Nir:

uploaded repository with basic time finding classes:

DeltaTimes, DelayFinder, SimpleDelayFinder, GausDelayFinder, ChannelTime, AntennaPair

also main.cxx and Makefile for testing different methods. 



=============================================================

8/7/14 Guy Nir:

=============================================================

8/20/14 Guy Nir:


Added Reconstruction class, VertexFinder class and some subclasses:

ScanVertexFinder, SphericalScanVertexFinder : scan all values in eithe cartesian or spherical cooridnates
MinuitVertexFinder uses minuit to find minimum chi2 (works best with good starting point). 


=============================================================

9/6/14 Guy Nir:

Added ranking and original qaulity parameter fields in ChannelTime and AntennaPair. Added ranking in DelayFinder and DeltaTimes (some implementation still needed).

Added a pairToChannels() method in DelayFinder, using linear least squares method based on linear algebra package 'Eigen'

=============================================================

10/10/14 Christian Bora:

Added ASM as a subclass of VertexFinder

Added L0FileReader class to read L0 files

Updated StationGeometry class to work with AraRoot geometry

=============================================================

10/9/14 Guy Nir:

Integrated ASM finder and L0FileReader into the framework. 

Made the reco framework independent of AraRoot and AraSim. 

===========================================================

11/04/14 Christian Bora

Made ASM use all combinations of antennas and take average solution

Updated L0FileReader to generate a stationGeometry object from AraRoot & misc updates

Added an additional constructor to StationGeometry and functions to add independent channel position

===========================================================

12/03/14 Christian Bora:

Added 2 Configuration classes that parses configurations from a text file

Changed methods name to enums, and made misc updates to DeltaTimes & Reconstruction class to use these enums

Uploaded an example of the main loop 

Made a base class for all the Minuit Related methods(MinuitVertexFinder), that will inherit from the VertexFinder class

============================================================
02/05/14 Christian Bora:

Added Prototype for AraSimFileReader - has a bug, crashes when trying to access AraTree

L0FileReader(removed memory leak) & misc updates

Header files contains doxygen comments
Added functionality to methods to only reconstruct when we have at least 4 hits
============================================================


02/12/15 Guy Nir:

Extensive changes to time finding methods... 
Added Pos class (holds x,y,z and gives back R, phi, theta if requested)
Added Timing class (holds time finding results such as time, weight, error)
Added Channel class that gives position, timing data and keeps waveforms for one antenna.
Channel also holds a list of TimeFinder objects (each one uses a different method to find the hit time inside the specific channel). 

TimeFinder replaces the functionality of DelayFinder and lives inside Channel objects, rather than being given a vector of channel id's and a vector of waveforms to scan over. 

Each Channel also holds a vector of vectors of DeltaFinder objects (DeltaFinder replaces DelayFinders that work pairwise like cross-crrelation finder). 

Added ChannelCollection class to hold a vector of Channel objects and has a few functions to loop over all its Channels (like applying finders to all channels) and can give a new ChannelCollection with any subset of the channels inside it (e.g. only Vpol) 

Added TimingMatrix class to help pass around the pairwise timing (which by definition needs a matrix of Nchan by Nchan positions). This is a simple container that easily prints itself and can be handed to reconstruction methods down the line. 

Added ThreshTimeFinder and CrossDeltaFinder as applications time and delay finding classes. 

Began work to integrate the new classes (StationGeometry can output Pos objects, but still internally does not use them exclusively, EventGenerator outputs Channel objects but still doesn't use them internally). 

Also made some initial work to split the code into different modules living in distinct directories. 

==============================================================

03/01/15 Guy Nir:

moved all relevant classes into modules: Geometry, Input, TimeFinding, VertexFinding.

Fixed up VertexFinder and updated MinuitVertexFinder to fit the new scheme. There is no longer need for CartesianMinuitVertexFinder or SphericalMinuitVertexFinder, we simply pass spherical/cartesian using switches. The use of hit times or pair delays is also chosen using switches. 

todo: add parameter lock using switches. 

Added RealVertexFinder utility class that copies the real position into the found position and adds a gaussian error on parameters (enter error using par1).

todo: ScanVertexFinder needs to be refitted to the new scheme, and add functionality to save histograms of the scan. 

todo: check full data path from generator to vertex position.

todo: add functionality to get residulas (into histogram?) from VertexPos. 

todo: VertexPos::calculateCartesian() and VertexPos::calculateSpherical() for error conversion. 

===================================================================

03/01/15 Christian Bora

Updated L0FileReader to work with the new time Finding scheme

===================================================================

03/05/15 Christian Bora

Added CSW class 
todo: change it to be called from Channel

=================================================================

03/10/15 Christian Bora

Added functionalites for CSW to be called from Channel, and the CSW customized loop over channels in ChannelCollection

Added additional info in TimingMatrix to print channel numbers along their columns

Integrated SimpleTimeFinder to fit in the new scheme

todo: calibrate weights, & errors for Simple and CSW

=================================================================

03/12/15 Guy Nir

added covariance matrix for errors in VertexPos. still need to fix asymmetric errors. 

=================================================================

03/25/15 Guy Nir

Added EventVertex, container for multiple VertexFinder objects. controls what finders are used, and calls:
VertexPos::meanVertexPos() a new method that takes a vector of VertexPos pointers (or VertexFinder pointers) and calculates the weighted average of the position and the covariance matrices (is this the best thing to do??)

==================================================================

03/27/15 Guy Nir:

Rewritten EventData to contain less stuff and rely on VertexPos and ChannelCollection and EventVertex to contain all the data. 

Added SimData to the EventData class to keep "real" info about the simulated event (energy, flavor etc.).

fixed EventGenerator to use new classes (Pos, Channel).


================================================================
04/1/2015 Christian Bora

added AntPos object to inherit from Pos and add more useful antenna info
Updated StationGeometry to use a vector of AntPos
Updated L0/AraSim FileReader
Modified GausTimeFinder and AnalyticVertexFinder

====================================================================

04/13/2015  Christian Bora

added MapSearchVertexFinder , R, theta, phi scan method
added prototype of L2Data -- for data warehouse useful information

==================================================================

 04/16/2015 Christian Bora

Uploading runnable L2Data for Icrr

==================================================================

04/18/2015 Christian Bora

Updated L2Data to hold information for both Icrr and Atri like stations
Updated L0FileReader to provide necessary info to L2Data - to provide Useful event



==================================================================

05/08/2015 Guy Nir

Added the MCMCVertexFinder class. Uses Markov chain Monte Carlo method to locate vertex. 
Also fixed VertexPos to hold errors in a covariance matrix. The calculation for cartesian->spherical is still missing. 
Asymmetric errors is still missing. 

==================================================================

05/12/2015 Guy Nir

Added file saving to root file (class format).
Reconstruction controls what is saved/deleted. 
Made all classes derived from TObject and have ClassDef/ClassImp (may regret that some day...)
Adjusted the code conventions and class roundup in README


==================================================================

05/14/15 Guy Nir

Added IntMapVertexFinder for using Interference maps instead of timefinding in the reconstruction. 
Takes the graphs saved in Channel->CorrGraph objects (also a new class) and uses them to build histogram maps of the interference values. 
CorrGraph just stores a TGraph and two pointers to Channel objects, and can call FFTtools::getCorrelationGraph().
They are lazy filled when calling IntMapVertexFinder or when using CrosDeltaFinder. 
The maps are stacked and the highest point is chosen as vertex position. 
For unlock R (if more than one value is scanned) is a logarithmic axis around the current best position. 


===================================================================

05/15/15 Christian Bora

OpticalIce - fixing index of refrac. model to return 1 above surface

==================================================================

05/15/15 Christian Bora

CurvedRay - Added Ray Trace algorithm from Andrew...
AnalyticVertexFinder - set to call statusFailed when no answer is found


===================================================================

Channel - Making sure every delete has an "if" statement to avoid crashes
Reconstruction - added L0FileReader to Reco -- as now tested for TestBed
L0/AraSimFileReader - changing getGeometry() to getStationGeometry()

==================================================================

05/26/15 Christian Bora

Updating channelCollection to draw hit times found on waveforms

Updating Reco to use these filters
Added a DrawTime class

=================================================================

05/27/15 Christian Bora

Updating Reco, L0 & EventData to work with L2Data
Included SimData for AraSimFileReader
Removed the delete lines of channels from EventData - Readers should be responsible for this

=================================================================
06/03/15 Christian Bora

Added MaxCorrOrderer: class to order channels by their max correlation values
Added ExpectedDeltaFinder: class to compute expected time difference between channels
L0FileReader does not, by default, include surface antennas - as this affects the origin,
	     Now reads VRMS file
AntPos now holds information about VRMS
CSW : zero meaned graphs
ChannelCollection: uses MaxCorrOrderer before applying CSW
TimeFinder now has StationGeometry object that it points
ThreshTimeFinder now reads threshold information from AntPos
Added Earliest/AnyWhereVertexFinder : helper classes to help define starting position
a new DEBUGGING.txt for notes about bugs that are known

==================================================================

06/11/15 Guy Nir:

added the Reco framework to the ARA svn at UW:

https://svnmsn.icecube.wisc.edu/ara/Software/Reconstruction


====================================================================

06/11/15 Christian Bora

Simply checking if I have write rights to this link

==================================================================
06/12/15 Christian Bora

Moved macCorrOrderer to ChannelCollection
Added a directory RecoData + thresholds(VRMS) of TestBed, ARA02, ARA03 
ThreshTimeFinder -- thresholds are now read from the geometry object
Reconstruction -- updating reader function
EventData -- updating L2data related function
L2Data -- updated for more includes (cannot be saved)

================================================================
07/14/15 Christian Bora

Fixed Memory leaks

Driver: class that can be used to execute commands
Added scripts examples : exampleLoop.cxx, testDriver.cxx

===============================================================

07/20/15 Christian Bora

Updating Ice model with values from paper(2014) that agree with Andrew's studies

===============================================================

07/28/15 Christian Bora

Debugging ASM & OpticalIce -- made sure the IoR is correct

=============================================================

08/04/15 Christian Bora	

Adding MinuitUNLKU version with 4 parameters

=============================================================

08/08/15 Guy Nir

Rewritten Reconstruction class to be more lightweight, 
removed a lot of its functionality that exists in Parser and Output.
Added the VertexResult class, that holds a single VertexFinder 
and links to other VertexResult objects, that allows users to run
analysis on the whole linked list recursively. 
Started remodelling the VertexFinder class so each object can 
be created once and reused with each event, inputing the ChannelCollection 
and the initial position each time in the call to findVertex(). 

=============================================================

08/09/15 Guy Nir

Added the THX histogram class. It can take either 1, 2 or 3 dimensions, 
and can be filled by different VertexFinders as they scan parameter space, 
whatevet the locked parameters may be. It can output an histogram in any dimension, 
so it can be used to safely store parameter scans in different dimensionality 
that can be plotted later and compared. 
VertexFinder has been updated to have the new THX, also added copy constructor. 
The subclasses have not yet been updated... to be wrapped up in a few days. 

============================================================

10/11/15 Christian Bora
Added EventViewer classes
Methods validated MinuitUNLKU, Scan, Threshold, MCMC, 

============================================================

10/21/15 Christian Bora

Adding Calibration classes

============================================================

01/06/16 Guy Nir

Fixed THX class. now it holds a list of ValuePos objects, and can 
draw a histogram of any dimension on demand. 
ValuePos is a subclass of Pos that also holds a value. 
This value can be chi-square (default) or any other quality parameter.
This is used to draw probability distributions. 

============================================================

01/07/16 Guy Nir

Did some cleanup, removed a lot of uneeded classes from the mix:
EventData, Output, MinuitUNLKUVertexFinder, Configuration, 
ConfigVertex, Parser, Driver, VertexResult, EventVertex

All were moved to a new folder, GraveYard, where they will be stored
until someone has time to work on them. 

Removed much of the functionality of Reconstruction class. 
It now mainly works to set the static pointers of Channel and CurvedRay. 
When I have time I will try to bring it back to use. 

Cleaned up all places where a "std::" was missing. 

Added a UserGuide tex folder to docs/, still working on it.

ALSO: detached a few modules I didn't know if they were working:
EventViewer, Filtering, Calibration

============================================================

01/13/16 Guy Nir

Adapted the L0FileReader to a new improved version called FileReader. 
L0FileReader class has been moved to the graveyard. 
Class Input is no longer base class for EventGenerator, as it will be removed soon. 

FileReader will be the base class for SimFileReader, coming soon. 
The new file reader is based on TChain so you can give it file name argument like "*.root" 
and it will load all root files in the directory. 

============================================================


01/18/16 Guy Nir

Added copy constructor and getDeepCopy() to all vertex finders. 

============================================================

01/31/16 Guy Nir

Returned EventData class, in a new and much simplified version. 
Then changed TreeWriter to hold only an EventData object and write 
that directly to the root file. 

============================================================

02/02/16 Guy Nir

Fixed some bugs in StationGeometry and VertexPos. 
The scripts/dataLoop.c is now working ok with IntMapVertexFinder. 
Still a lot of work, but basically reader->writer chain is up and running. 

Took out the Reco class completely.

============================================================

02/09/16 Guy Nir

added text parsing functionality to VertexFinder (and IntMapVertexFinder)
This will soon replace the constructors for the finders altogether. 
fixed some bugs in CrosDeltaFinder. 


============================================================

02/10/16 Guy Nir

added the SimFileReader class to replace AraSimFileReader, 
and fixed FileReader. Now both are functioning and can be used. 
See scripts simLoop.c and dataLoop.c

The old classes Input, L0FileReader and AraSimFileReader are 
moved to the Graveyard. 

The SimFileReader will look for waveforms in the files along
this order:

1) eventTree under Icrr type events
2) eventTree under Atri type events
3) AraTree2 for report class

============================================================
