short list of things to do...

Input / Geometry:
-Rewrite EventGenerator to use new classes and dump dependency on old classes. DONE
-Rewrite StationGeometry to use Pos and maybe make it more flexible. Update L0FileReader to new geometry class implementation. DONE
-Fix AraSimFileReader. CHRISTIAN - TESTING
-CurvedRay to use raytracing to find curved path and time data. ???
-Configuration class to use new classes structure and dependencies. CHRISTIAN

TimeFinding:
-CSWTimeFinder, make sure everything works (who is responsible for deleting the CSW graph?). CHRISTIAN
-Add channel/pair level filters (already built into time finders?) and let ChannelCollection complain when not enough channels have w>0. DISCUSSION
-Add check to see if Channel has waveforms to use... GUY
-Change TimeFinder so it holds a pointer to its Channel. GUY
-How to add calibration constants to an analysis.... DISCUSSION

VertexFinding:
-VertexPos error scheme: add assymetric errors. GUY
-VertexPos error scheme: transition from Cartesian to Spherical isn't fully functional. TESTING
-AnalyticMethodVertexFinder: move to new scheme (constructor+inheritance from VertexPos). CHRISTIAN
-EventData: write tree as L2 doubles/ints directly (non-class tree format). ???
-EventData: add fields for all the housekeeping data from sim/L0 files. CHRISTIAN
-SimData: fill with all useful AraSim results (like Report class). GUY/CHRISTIAN
-Add checks that enough channels have w>0 and what to do if not. DISCUSSION
-general vertex finding: wrap around for angles... GUY
-MapSearchVertexFinder: R, theta phi search with closing bounds ... CHRISTIAN - TESTING
-VertexPos: Add more comments around functions... GUY
-VertexFinder: get some TH3D output for non-par-lock vertex finders somehow... GUY

PhaseMapping (new module)
-got integrated into VertexFinding... 

Filters (new module)
-consider which cuts can be applied after reconstruction is done. DISCUSSION
-combine with cuts on vertex confidence maybe? DISCUSSION
-

Testing ground:
-plot some residuals for time finding results based on generator. ???
-plot some residuals for vertex finding results based on generator. ???
-integrate run time comparisons for each finder (time/vertex) inside classes, or make a loop that tests this. DISCUSSION


Documentation:
-Some Latex document for casual user and for programmer. GUY
-Doxygen for web based documentation. CHRISTIAN
-general testing chart with results of each algorith: run time, vertex pos errors, botched reconstructions etc... DISCUSSION
-present such result for current methods in a nice table. ???
-add help() methods to some of the classes. GUY
